# Analyzing Baywheels Trip Data
## by JD Pritchett


## Dataset

>  The original dataset consisted of 154,967 different user trips in July of 2020 and was trimmed to 75,921 different user trips after cleaning.   The start day and month variables were extracted from the original timestamp data and were converted to categorical variables.  The different types of bikes and users were two other categorical variables used.  The only two numeric variables analyzed were the duration and distance variables.


## Summary of Findings

> After looking at different visualziations, I found that there were more docked bikes ridden than electric bikes used, and there were more casual users than members.  The trip behavior varies between the two user types, most notably when they start their trips.  Casual users tended to prefer the weekends for their use, and members tended to prefer the evenings during the weekdays.  I also found that the longer that a person spent on a bike had only a week correlation to how far that person actually traveled on the bike.


## Key Insights for Presentation

> For the presentation, I wanted to focus on the trends that I noticed during the exploration.  I chose the distribution of the day and time started for the entire dataset to set up the audience for a comparison.  I showed them a correlation between time and distance, so the audience could see that they were weekly correlated.  I then showed them the difference in start time and day between casual users and members, so the audience could compare that to the overal trend shown first.
